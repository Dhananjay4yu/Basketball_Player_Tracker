# üèÄ Basketball Player Detection  

Real-time **object detection system** to identify and track basketball players in video streams.  
This project is a foundation for **advanced sports analytics**, leveraging deep learning to achieve **lightweight, fast, and accurate** detection.  

---

## Project Goal  
To develop a **real-time basketball player detection system** that balances **accuracy** and **speed**, making it suitable for live sports analytics applications.  

---

##  Objectives  
-  Detect and track basketball players in real-time  
-  Build a **lightweight yet accurate** object detection pipeline  
-  Lay the groundwork for **future sports analytics** (heatmaps, movement analysis, performance tracking)  

---

## Technical Methodology & Tools  

###  Core Technology  
- **YOLOv5 (Ultralytics)**  
- Benchmarked against **YOLOv8** and **YOLOv11** with varying epochs  
- YOLOv5 provided the **best trade-off** between **speed (FPS)** and **accuracy (mAP)**, making it ideal for real-time inference  

###  Tools Used  
- **Google Colab GPU** ‚Äì Model training  
- **Roboflow** ‚Äì Dataset preparation and augmentation  
- **Ultralytics YOLO** ‚Äì Training & inference  
- **OpenCV** ‚Äì Video stream processing
